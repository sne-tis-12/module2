## Contract

The core logic of the Test Your Luck DApp is implemented in the Solidity smart contract `MyContract.sol`. The contract handles the guessing game and prize management.

### Contract Details

- `guessNum`: The target number that users need to guess correctly.
- `requiredDeposit`: The amount of Ether required to participate in the game.
- `CorrectGuess` event: Triggered when a user guesses the correct number.
- `IncorrectGuess` event: Triggered when a user's guess is incorrect.

### Functionality

- `getEtherAmount()`: Retrieves the current balance of the contract.
- `makeGuess(uint userGuess)`: Allows a user to make a guess by providing their chosen number. Requires a deposit of at least 5 Ether.
- `widthdraw(address payable winner)`: Allows the winner to withdraw the entire prize money.

## Frontend

The Test Your Luck DApp uses the ether.js library to interact with the Ethereum network on the frontend. The frontend is implemented in JavaScript and provides an intuitive user interface for users to participate in the game and manage their winnings.

### Features

- `makeGuess()`: Submits the user's guess and initiates the game.
- `withdrawPrizeMoney()`: Allows the winner to withdraw their prize money.

   npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
   ```

3. Start the frontend:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Connect your Metamask wallet to the local network.
